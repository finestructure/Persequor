# This module wraps the XMLRPC interface of
# trac (http://trac.edgewall.org/) into a ruby library.
# You can now easily access trac from any ruby
# application without having to handle all the 
# (trivial) XMLRPC calls.
#
# Example (receive list of opened tickets):
#   require 'trac4r/trac'
#   trac = Trac.new "http://dev.example.com/trac/my_awesome_project"
#   trac.tickets.list :include_closed => false #=> [7,9,3,5,14,...]
#
# Receive one single ticket
#   ticket = trac.tickets.get 9 #=> #<Trac::Ticket:0xb76de9b4 ... >
#   ticket.summary #=> 'foo'
#   ticket.description #=> 'bar'
# See documentation for Trac::Ticket for what methods you can call on ticket.
#
# Create a new ticket
#   trac.tickets.create "summary", "description", :type => 'defect', :version => '1.0', :milestone => 'bug free' #=> 10
# summary and description are required, the rest is optional. It can be one of the following:
# :severity, :milestone, :status, :type, :priority, :version, :reporter, :owner, :cc, :keywords
# 
module Trac
  # returns a new instance of Trac::Base
